# AC3.2-weLearn

When weLearn, everyone wins!

We are MVC...K, a team of junior developers at Coalition for Queens, a fellowship for under-represented minorities in tech. weLearn is our capstone project, the culimnation of many long months spent in technical training.

We designed weLearn as a fully mobile learning management system (LMS), to directly address our needs as students in a tech fellowship. At C4Q, we use email and Slack to keep connected. Slack is an amazing piece of technology, but the chat-room format makes it so easy for important links, grades, and announcements to get lost in the mix. weLearn is here to help!

Unlike other LMS, such as Blackboard, weLearn puts the student first. We cut down on niche features to keep our app more focused and easy for students to use. 

On the backend, instructors use the familar format of GoogleSheets to upload grades, assignments, and announcements. They can even reward students with special achievement badges. This fosters a lively classroom culture and encourages students to strive.

In the future, we hope to implement push notifications, so students can be updated on the go, annotated audio/video recording of lessons similar to Soundcloud's format, and a fully integrated instructor-facing UI.
